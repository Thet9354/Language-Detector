### Language Detector Script

#### Overview:
This Python script utilizes the `langdetect` module to identify the language of entered text. It provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using `tkinter`, featuring labels, buttons, and an entry field. Users can input text, and upon submission, the script detects the language and displays the result on the GUI.

#### Installation:
Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required `langdetect` module via pip:

```bash
pip install langdetect
```

#### Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. The GUI window will appear, featuring an entry field and a button labeled "Detect Language".
3. Enter the text you wish to analyze into the entry field.
4. Click the "Detect Language" button.
5. The script will process the entered text and display the detected language abbreviation on the GUI.

#### Notes:
- The detected language is returned as abbreviated language codes. For example, English text will be represented as 'en'.
- The `langdetect` module uses statistical analysis to determine the language of the input text. While it provides accurate results in many cases, it may not always be 100% accurate, especially for short or ambiguous text.
- Users should ensure a stable internet connection, as `langdetect` may require online resources for language detection.

#### Example:
- If you input English text, the detected language abbreviation displayed will be 'en'.
- Similarly, for French text, the abbreviation 'fr' will be shown.
- The script supports a wide range of languages and will attempt to identify the language regardless of its origin.

#### Disclaimer:
- This script is provided as-is, without any warranties or guarantees. Users are encouraged to review and modify the script according to their specific needs and use cases.
- The accuracy of language detection may vary depending on factors such as text length, language complexity, and available resources.
